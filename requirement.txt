LMS design:

A system to efficiently organize manage, and store information related to books, periodicals and other media.
Provide a centralized platform for managing Library resources, tracking book loans, and returns and streamlining the overall operation of the library.

it support library staff in inventory management.

tools:

- Sorting algorithm: display of library items based on various attributes
- Searching attribute: retrieval of book information

operation:
- CRUD operation
- display options
- Search mechanism

Strategy:
OOP appraoch to build our system  

one module to store the data structure class of our program
one module to store the object class of our program
one module to store our different algorithm
the main file that will contain our program and call the object and function

- DSA class should contain:
linked list class
stack class
hash table class

- object class should contain
user class
library manager class
library transiction system class
library metadata class

- algorithm module should contain:
searching algorithm
soritng algorithm

the Main file will import other module to use them this design decision has been made to keep things clear and simple, OOP is the standard approach  for big and complex problems.

The use of SQL may be require to store our data permanently.
